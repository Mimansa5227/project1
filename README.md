## GitHub Users in Chicago Analysis

## How I Scraped the Data
This project uses the GitHub API to scrape data on users in Chicago with over 100 followers, collecting their profile information, including details like name, bio, company, and email, along with metadata on each userâ€™s public repositories, including creation date, primary language, and license.

## Interesting Findings
One of the most surprising findings was the number of users with a significant follower count yet limited public repositories, indicating potential untapped talent in the community.

## Recommendations
Based on this analysis, developers should focus on creating documentation and enabling wiki support for their projects, as these features can significantly enhance project credibility, user engagement, and overall usability, which may lead to higher star counts and sustained community interest in the project.
